# 5DOF-Robot-Arm-Design

This repository contains a simple 3D design of a robotic arm with 5 degrees of freedom (DOF).


# Files

- `robot_arm_design.png` → 3D illustration of the robot arm.
- `robot_arm_5dof.stl` → 3D model file for simulation or 3D printing.
- `README.md` → Task description.

# Degrees of Freedom:

The robotic arm is designed with 5 Degrees of Freedom :

1. Base Rotation —> rotates the entire arm around its vertical axis.
2. Shoulder Movement —> moves the first arm segment up and down.
3. Elbow Movement —> bends and extends the second segment.
4. Wrist Movement —> moves the end segment up and down.
5. Gripper Action —> opens and closes the gripper to hold objects.

**Designed using TinkerCAD platform.**

# How to Use

1. Download the `robot_arm_5dof.stl` file.
2. Import it into **TinkerCAD**, or any 3D viewer.
3. Use `robot_arm_design.png` to view labeled structure and understand the model layout.
4. Simulate or print the model as needed.
